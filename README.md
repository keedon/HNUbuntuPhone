# HNUbuntuPhone
Hacker News browser for Ubuntu Phone

This project is a dedicated browser for Hacker News to run on Ubuntu Touch.  Currently it only supports browse mode and 
I haven't been able to try it on a real phone, since I'm still waiting for mine to arrive.

TODO:

 - Allow login and commenting
 - Fix the issue where comment text is clipped
 - Submit articles from other apps (no idea how to do this yet)
 - Test it on a real phone
